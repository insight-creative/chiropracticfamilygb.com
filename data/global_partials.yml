        <strong>Dr. Emily is the best!</strong> She was very in tune to me and knew exactly what needed to be adjusted. She went above and beyond to make sure that I could get back to the gym and enjoy working out pain free without taking time off to heal."

        I have been going to chiropractors since I was 16 and in that time I have only had one chiropractor successfully adjust my neck. After seeing Dr. Emily she was able to successfully adjust me and my neck. <strong>I have never felt better!</strong> She is amazing!!"

        I can never thank Dr. Emily enough for being the first person to listen to me about my pain in my back, and working until she found a solution. <strong>3 years of chronic pain and SHE figured it out.</strong>"
