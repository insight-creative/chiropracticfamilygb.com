#### C. WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSURE YOUR INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION (IIHI) IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS

The following categories describe the different ways in which we may use and disclose your IIHI.

1. **Treatment.** Our practice may use your IIHI to treat you. For example, we may ask you to have laboratory tests (such as blood or urine tests), and we may use the results to help us reach a diagnosis. Any of the people who work for our practice – including, but not limited to, our doctors and nurses, or indirectly with any provider we refer you to – may use or disclose your IIHI in order to treat you, or to assist others in your treatment. Additionally, we may need to disclose your IIHI to others who may assist in your care, such as your spouse, children, or parents.

2. **Payment.** Our practice may use and disclose your IIHI in order to bill and collect payment for the services and items you may receive from us. For example, we may contact your health insurer to certify that you are eligible for benefits (and for what range of benefits), and we may provide your insurer with details regarding your treatment and health status to determine if your insurer will cover, or pay for, your treatment. We also may use and disclose your IIHI to obtain payment from third parties that may be responsible for such costs, such as family members or insurance companies. Also, we may use your IIHI to bill you directly for services and items.

3. **Health Care Operations.** Our practice may use and disclose your IIHI to operate our business. As examples of the ways in which we may use and disclose your information for our operations, our practice may use your IIHI to evaluate the quality of care you receive from us, or to conduct cost-management and business planning activities for our practice.

For example, a parent or guardian may ask that a babysitter take their child to our office for care. In this example, the babysitter may have access to this child’s medical information.
